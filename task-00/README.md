# INSTALLATION OF UBUNTU
  I had it download from the website given in tasks for refering and installation i referred youtube and while i got doubt i once contacted my senior in discord group.Well after installing at first i felt its a bit hard to use but later getting used i am liking it a lot it is giving me the feel of using a laptop like running the code in the terminal which is very powerful.In short i am loving it.
