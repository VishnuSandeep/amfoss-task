## About Tasks
I could say that the tasks were a lot of difficult.Only people acquring enough knowledge can do this tasks.So people best of best only can do the tasks.i could not even do half of the tasks but i tried and was doing task till the very end.I learnt many things like how to use google, how to approach a problem with 0 knowledge and solve it.i learnt many things which will help in future.
## About Me
I am from hyderabad.I was born in khammam and studied in nagpur till 1st class and thereafter continued my studied my studies in shillong,Meghalayam till 5th class.After that i continued my studies in hyderabad till my inter.I actually never know about computer till my 10th and started playing games in my inter.I never had computers subject till now and that maybe one reason why i couldnt solve many tasks and felt a lot of difficulties in solving the few i did. But i never gave up on anything tried till the very end and always wanted to give my best.I love coding i am very passionate about coding.There is no particular reason for joining in amrita its just i didnt computerscience branch in the colleges i wanted. But i only wanted to pursue computer science so as Amrita is the best platform I joined here but there is a reason for choosing amritapuri campus as I was told that the club in amritapuri campus are very good i came to amritapuri campus.I hope I will be able to get enough knowledge and achieve my goal of becoming a successful person and inspiration to others. My inspiration is Naruto Uzumaki.
